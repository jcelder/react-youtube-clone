# React Youtube Clone

This is a simple Youtube Clone built with React. It was built as part of Stephen Grider's Modern React with Redux Udemy course. Interested in learning Modern React and Redux? If so I highly recommend his course [here](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/).

## Getting Started

#### Clone and Install the Project
Run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/jcelder/react-youtube-clone.git
cd react-youtube-clone
npm install
```
#### Get a Youtube API Key
- Visit the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com) and obtain a Youtube Data API v3 Key
- Copy the .env template to .env by running the following command
  - `cp .env.template .env`
- Add your API key to the `.env` file

#### To run the project
`npm start`
Visit `localhost:8080`
Enjoy!
